AWS Devenv
==========

This is a bunch of utilities to alow easy setting up of some development
environments on AWS. Supported are Ubuntu, Centos and Windows.

The scripts provide for setting up a VPC and securty groups for running
isolated from other systems. By default only access from the user's
original network is provided, although there are also utilities for adding
and removing access.

Prerequisites:
--------------

* AWS CLI
* AWS credentials that allow for setting up all the components
* Vagrant
* vagrant-aws and vagrant-aws-winrm plugins
* xfreerdp

You need to apply the patch to the Vagrant plugin to allow region overriding.

Getting Started
---------------

Create a file called `myenv`. It needs to have 2 things:

. `AWS_PROFILE=profilename`
. one or more AMI lines, e.g.
    `WIN_AMI="ami-0b7ebdd52b84c244d"`
	possible keys are `WIN_AMI`, `CENTOS_AMI` and `UBUNTU_AMi`.

Also possible are settings for:

. `AWS_REGION`
. `AZ` - the availability zone to use
. `KEY` - the name of an SSH key to generate and/or use

Run once: `./aws_setup.sh`

This will record details of the environment in a file called `settings`

Now you can run `vagrant up <machinename>` where that's one of
`windows`, `centos` or `ubuntu`.

Once the machine is provisioned, you can connect to it like this

. for the Unix machines, run `vagrant ssh <machinename>`
. for Windows, run `vwinrdp`
